## - Problem 1: Fast Exponentiation

>$base^{exp} \bmod m$
>
> using 2 naîve algorithms and *algorithm 5*
> ### sample runs:
> ![run1](/img/fastexp1.png)
>
> ---
>
> ![run2](/img/fastexp2.png)
> As it is stated in the previous sample runs:
> Both naîve algorithms take extremely big amounts of time to finish, compared to both implementations of algorithm 5, which take less than a millisecond.

> ### Overflows
>
> Algorithm 5 breaks (overflows) when the number of bits representing the exponent gets large, for example:
> In the following sample run: the number of bits = 30
> ![break](/img/fastexpbreak2.png)
## - problem 2:

>all prime numbers before *n*

## - problem 3:

>Trial division to determine whether *n* is *prime*.
